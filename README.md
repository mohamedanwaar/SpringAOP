# ðŸŒ€ Spring AOP Example Project

This project demonstrates how to use **Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)** in a Spring Boot application to cleanly separate cross-cutting concerns such as **logging**, **execution time tracking**, and **exception handling**. The project includes **visual test cases** that show the output of AOP in action.

âœ… **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**  
- Custom annotations:
  - `@Logging`: Logs method entry and exit.
  - `@TrackTime`: Tracks and logs method execution duration.
- **Exception Logging** using `@AfterThrowing` advice.

âœ… **Spring Boot**  
- Simplified configuration and setup for quick development.

âœ… **Maven**  
- Used for dependency management and build automation.

âœ… **Visual Test Cases**  
- Includes test cases that demonstrate AOP features in a clear, readable format (console outputs or logs).
